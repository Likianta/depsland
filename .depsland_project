# What's this

This file is used for depsland package to check itself whether in project mode
or in python package mode.

# How is this file used

1. When you clone depsland project from Github repo, you will get this file in
   the project root.
2. The `depsland/paths.py : class Project : def __init__` will check if this
   file exists.

   - If true, depsland knows it is in project mode, all related folders are
     already created.
   - If not (for users who use `pip install depsland`), depsland will first
     create a "virtual" project root.

     See the details in `depsland/paths.py : class Project :
     def _init_project_root`.
